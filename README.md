# Car-price-prediction
## Aim
### This project aims to predict the price of used Cars by considering some features.

## Some packages are:
Numpy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Sklearn

## How its done?
1.This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.

2.It then predicts the possible price of the car.

3.This data was super unclean.it than cleaned using string functions etc..... and analysed.

4.Then a linear regression model was built on it which got 0.82 r2_score.

5.And then Random forest regressor was built on it which got accuracy of 94 and 0.87 r2_score.

6.Comparetively random forest gave good result in terms of less error.
